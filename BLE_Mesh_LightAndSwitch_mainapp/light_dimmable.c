/** @file
 *
 * This demo application shows a simple implementation of a dimmable light.
 * The app is based on the snip/mesh/mesh_light_lightness sample which
 * implements BLE Mesh Light Lightness Server model. Because Light Lightness
 * Server model extends Generic OnOff and Generic Level, the dimmable
 * light can be controlled by a Switch (Generic OnOff Client), a Dimmer
 * (Generic Level Client), or by an application which implements Light
 * Lightness Client.  The WICED Mesh Models library takes care of the
 * translation of the OnOff and Level messages and the only messages
 * that the application layer needs to process is those of the Light
 * Lightness Model.
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 *  - LED usage on the EVK
 *  - Processing of the Light Lightness messages
 *
 * To demonstrate the app, work through the following steps.
 * 1. Build and download the application (to the WICED board)
 * 2. Build and download a controlling application (to another WICED board)
 *    (for example apps/demo/dimmer project)
 * 3. Use Mesh Client or Client Control to provision a light bulb and a dimmer
 * 4. Configure dimmer to control the light bulb.
 *    (note that the bulb and the dimmer were provisioned in the same group,
 *    the dimmer will be automatically configured to send messages to the group
 *    and this step can be skipped.
 * 5. Push/release the application button on the dimmer.  The LED on the light
 *    side should turn on.
 * 6. Push/release the application button on the dimmer.  The LED on the light
 *    side should turn off.
 * 7. Push and hold the application button on the dimmer.  The LED on the light
 *    side should gradually go from off to on within 4 seconds.
 * 8. Push and hold the application button on the dimmer.  The LED on the light
 *    side should gradually go from on to off within 4 seconds.
 * 9. Try pushing and holding button for less than 4 seconds, and all other
 *    combinations.
